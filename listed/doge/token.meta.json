    "description": "Dogecoin is a peer-to-peer cryptocurrency based on a Shiba Inu meme that went viral on social media. At first, Dogecoin was created in jest at other cryptocurrency projects that were being launched at the time, but it quickly grew a devoted fan base that discovered and developed new use cases around the token. It is regarded as the first \"meme coin.\" While the native token, DOGE, was initially developed without any specific utility, its use as a digital currency has increased over the years. As of September 2022, over 2,000 merchants across the globe accepted DOGE as payment."
