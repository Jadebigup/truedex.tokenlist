    "description": "Conflux Network is a scalable and decentralized blockchain network which aims to have high throughput and fast confirmation. The Conflux Network consensus algorithm operates with a special Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) structure called Tree-Graph. Unlike Ethereum which only accepts transactions on a single chain into its ledger, Tree-Graph incorporates and processes transactions in all concurrent blocks. CFX is Conflux Networkâ€™s native utility token and is used for network consensus, ecosystem incentivization, governance and staking."
