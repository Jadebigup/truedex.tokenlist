    "description": "Shiba Inu (SHIB) is a meme coin inspired by the Shiba Inu dog. Launched in August 2020 by an anonymous developer known as Ryoshi, the project aimed to build a decentralized and spontaneous community. The token operates on the Ethereum blockchain as an ERC-20 token. The Shiba Inu ecosystem consists of three tokens: SHIB, LEASH, and BONE. SHIB serves as the foundational currency and a medium of exchange. "
